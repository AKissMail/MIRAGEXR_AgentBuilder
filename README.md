# MirageXR Virtual Instructor Builder
instructor
This is a minimal Web frontend for the AI Servers of MirageXR. It enables the users to create and test RAG models for 
the Virtual instructor feature without additional programming knowledge. This release is an early one that addresses the
document API of backend servers. Its main focus is to provide an interface to upload a configuration, a document and a 
set of documents to make them available within the MirageXR system.

## How to set up
1. Install Node and yarn on your system.
2. Clone the repository and place it in a folder.
3. Run the following two commands in that folder:
```
yarn install 
yarn serve
```
Now you have a development deployment. In order to use the application in a sensible way, you must clone and install the
backend of the application. You can find it here the [Backend](https://github.com/AKissMail/MIRAGEXR_AI_service-backend).
